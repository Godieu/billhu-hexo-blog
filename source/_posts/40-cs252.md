## Information security

**Information security**: The **protection** of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide **confidentiality, integrity, and availability**.

- **Confidentiality**: the property that sensitive information is **not disclosed** to **unauthorized** individuals, entities or processes.

- **Integrity**: the property that sensitive data has **not been modified or deleted** in an **unauthorized and undetected** manner. 
- **Authentication**: the process of estabilishing confidence in the identity of users or information systems.
- **Non-Repudiation**: assurance that the sender of information is provided with proof of delivery and the recipient is provided with proof of the sender's identity, so neither can later deny having processed the information.

## Private-key Encryption (PrivKE)

![PrivKE](40-cs252/privke.png)

> - $\mathrm{Gen}$ = key generation, $\mathrm{Enc}$ = encryption, $\mathrm{Dec}$ = decryption
> - $k$ = secret key, $m$ = plaintext (message), $c$ = ciphertext
> - $\mathcal{K}$ = key space, $\mathcal{M}$ = plaintext space, $\mathcal{C}$ = ciphertext space

- $\mathrm{PrivKE} = (\mathrm{Gen, Enc, Dec}) + \mathcal{M}$
  - **Correctness**: $\mathrm{Dec(k, \mathrm{Enc}(k, m)) = m}$
  - **Security**: the adversary should not be able to learn $m$ from $c$



## Kerchkhoff's Principle

**Principle**: The **cipher method must not be required to be secret**, and it must ba able to fall into the hands of the enemy without inconvenience. 加密算法应该公开.
