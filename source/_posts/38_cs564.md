# Lec 2. SQL Basics I

## Relational model

A database is **a collection of one or more relations**.

**Relation**: a table with rows and columns.

**table name**; **attribute/column**; **record/tuple/row**

**Domain**: Each attribute has a specific type called domain (e.g. int, string. real...)

**Schema**: 
- The schema of a relation: relation name + attribute names.
- The schema of a database: a collection of relation schemas.

(relation = table)

**Primary key**: a subset of attributes that is a unique identifier of tuples in a relation.

- A **primary key** can have 1 or **more attributes**
- Primary key must be unique.
- A relation can only have **1 primary key**, but can have **multiple unique keys**.




## Structured Query Language (SQL)

- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**
  - Creation, deletion, modification of definitions of tables
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**
  - Query; Insert, delete and update rows

### Basics (creating a table)

**Create a Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Product (
    pid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,   -- 'only 1 primary key'
    name CHAR(30) UNIQUE,   -- like 'assert'
    category CHAR(20),
    price REAL,
    manufacturer CHAR(20)
);
```

**Insert to a Table**
```sql
INSERT INTO Product
VALUES 
    ('iPhone', 'phone', 999.00, 'Apple'),  -- use single quote!
    ('chromebook', 'laptop', 999.00, 'Google');
```

### Single-table queries

**Basic SQL Query**
```sql
SELECT [DISTINCT] <attributes>   -- use DISTINCT to remove duplicates
FROM <one table>
WHERE <conditions>
[ORDER BY] <attribute> DESC/ASC  -- default is ASC
[LIMIT] <number>  -- usually used with ORDER BY to get Top-K
```

`select *`: select all attributes of this relation.

`SELECT sname AS sailorName`: **rename** an attribute

`SELECT sname, (60-age) AS YearToRetire`: **arithmetic expression** (and rename)


**In WHERE clauses**:

- Attribute names
- Comparison operators: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- Operations on strings (e.g. concatenation)
- Pattern matching: (e.g. `s LIKE '%madison%'`)
- Special functions for comparing dates and times

Pattern matching: 
- `%` = any sequence of characters
- `_` = any single character


# Lec 3. SQL Basics II

## Integrity Constraint

**Integrity Constraint (IC)**: a condition specified on a database scheme and restricts the data that can be stored in an instance of database.

IC are specified when the user defines a database schema.

DBMS checks for violations and disallows changes to the data that violates the specified ICs (or make conpensating changes to the data to ensure all ICs are satisfied).

## Foreign Keys

(Another way to declare primary key

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
  sid   CHAR(20),
  name  CHAR(30),
  age   INTEGER,
  gpa   REAL,
  UNIQUE (name, age),
  CONSTRAINT StudentsKey PRIMARY KEY (sid)
);
```

equivalent to 

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
  sid   CHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
  name  CHAR(30),
  age   INTEGER,
  gpa   REAL,
  UNIQUE (name, age)
);
```
)


**Referenced attributes** must be **PRIMARY KEY (default) or UNIQUE**.

The foreign key in the referencing relation must match the primary key of the referenced relation. 

Must have **same number of columns and compatible data type**.

The column names can be different. 

A foreign key **must reference a valid, existing key** in the referenced table.

Syntax
```sql
FOREIGN KEY <list of attributes>
REFERENCES <relation> <attributes>
```

Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Enrolled (
  studid  CHAR(20),
  cid     CHAR(20),
  grade   CHAR(20),
  PRIMARY KEY (studid, cid),   -- primary key contains two attributes
  FOREIGN KEY (studid) REFERENCES Students  -- foreign key that refers to another table (Students)
);
```

Foreign key constraint can be violated in:

- A new row is inserted to `Enrolled` and references nonexistant value in `Students.
  - Operation will be **rejected**.


- A deletion or update to `Students` causes some tuples of `Enrolled` to dangle.

  - Solution 1: **ON DELETE/UPDATE NO ACTION** 
    - **disallow (reject)** deletion of the Students row (default).

  - Solution 2: **ON DELETE/UPDATE CASCADE**
    - delete/update rows in Enrolled that refer to the deleted Students row

  - Solution 3: **ON DELETE/UPDATE SET DEFAULT**
    - Set `studid` to some **default value**

  - Solution 4: **ON DELETE/UPDATE SET NULL**
    - Set `studid` value to **null**

Can specify the actions on **DELETE** and **UPDATE** separately (differently).


## Multi-table queries

Semantics of SQL: Multuple Tables

```sql
SELECT a1, a2, ... -- <attributes>
FROM   R1, R2, ... -- <relations/tables>
WHERE  <conditions>
```

e.g. names of students who got A in EE101

```sql
SELECT s.name
FROM   Students S, Enrolled E
WHERE  S.sid = E.studid
  AND  E.grade = 'A'
  AND  E.cid = 'EE101'
```







# Lec 4. Advanced SQL I

## SQL: Aggregation

- **`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`** can be applied to a column in a `SELECT` clause. 

- **`COUNT(*)`** counts the number of tuples

- **`COUNT (DISTINCT <attribute>)`** to remove duplicates before counting.

- If `SELECT` clause uses an aggregate operation, it must use only attribute operations unless the query contains a `GROUP BY` clause.

  Note: attribute and aggregated attribute cannot appear in `SELECT` at the same time.

  For example this is **incorrect**! `SELECT S.sname, MAX(S.age)`.



- Follow a `SELECT-FROM-WHERE` by **`GROUP BY`** and a list of attributes.

  The relation is then grouped according to the values of those attributes, and any aggregation is applied only **within each group**.

  E.g. 

  ```sql
  SELECT A, SUM(B*C)  FROM R  GROUP BY A;
  ```

  Restrictions: If any aggregation is used, each element in `SELECT` must be **either aggregated or an attribute in `GROUP BY` list**.

- The `HAVING` clause always follows a `GROUP BY` clause in a SQL query. 

  It **applies to each group**, and groups not satisfying the condition are removed.

  It can refer only to attributes of relations in the `FROM` clause.

  `HAVING` **applies only on aggregates**!



## SQL: NULLs

- Tuples in SQL relations can have NULL for attributes.

- When we do arithmetic operations using NULL, the result is NULL.

  e.g. `(10*x)+5` is NULL if `x` is NULL

- String concatenation is NULL if one of the operands is NULL

  e.g. `'wisconsin' || NULL` is NULL

- **3-valued logic**: TRUE=1, FALSE=0, UNKNOWN=0.5
  When any value is compared with a NULL, the result is **`UNKNOWN`**.

  - C1 AND C2:  min{value(C1), value(C2)}
  - C1 OR C2:  max{value(C1), value(C2)}
  - NOT C: 1 - value(C)

- Test for NULL explicitly:

  ```sql
  X IS NULL
  X IS NOT NULL
  ```

# Lec 6. ER Model I

## Database Design

- **Requirements** Analysis
- **Conceptual Database Design**
  - Model **high-level description** of data; constraints; ER model
- **Logical Database Design**
  - Choose a DBMS and design a scheme (How to map conceptual design to a schema?)



## ER Model

- A **visual language** to specify
  - What **information** the DB must hold
  - What are the **relationships** among components of that information

### Concepts

**Entity**: distinguishable real-world object (a single object, e.g. one sailer).

**Entity Set**: A set of entities (all entities have same set of attributes, e.g. all sailors). Rectangles.

**Attribute**: attached to an entity set. Ovals.

(ER diagrams don't represent entities. They represent entity sets!)

### Relationship

**Key Constraints**:

- **one-one**: A and B are both keys to the relationship. Given an entity A (or B), can uniquely determine the relationship.
- **many-one**: Given an entity in B, can uniquely determine the relationship.
- **many-many**: 



# Lec 7. ER Model II

**Roles in relationship**

- Lable the edges to indicate roles if one entity set plays more than one role

  ![](38_cs564/roles-in-relationship.jpg)

### **Participation constraint**

- **Key constraint**: (at most one) (represented by â†’)
- **Total participation**: (at least one) (represented by thick line)
- **Particial participation**: (participation that is not total)



### Weak Entities

A **weak entity** can only be identified uniquely by considering the primary key of another entity.

- Weak entity set must participate in **one-to-many** relationship set.
- Weak entity set must have **total participation**.

Example:

![](38_cs564/weak-entity.jpg)

e.g. We cannot uniquely determine 'dependent' by 'name'. Only by considering 'employees' can we determine 'dependent'. Therefore 'dependents' is weak entity.



### Class Hierarchy

![](38_cs564/class-hierarchy.jpg)

- Option 1: Don't care about subclass relationship. Build 3 tables.
- Option 2: Similar to option 1, except that all products will be in Product table. Will have duplicates
- Option 3: Only build one table. Judge type by checking whether attribute is null.





# Lec 9. Functional Dependencies

## Functional Dependency (FD)

**FD**s are a form of **constraint**

When two tuples have the same A attributes, their B attributes must be same.

We then say that

- A **functionally determines** B
- $A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_n \rightarrow B_1, B_2, \cdots, B_n$



Given a table with a set of tuples, we can confirm that a FD **seems to be valid**, **definitely invalid**, but we **cannot prove** that a FD is valid.



## Armstrong's Axioms

- **Reflexivity**: universal set can determine subset (e.g. $A,B,C\rightarrow A,B$)

- **Augmentation**: if $X\rightarrow Y$ then $X,Z \rightarrow Y,Z$  (add attrib on both sides) 
- **Transitivity**:  if $X\rightarrow Y$ and $Y \rightarrow Z$, then $X\rightarrow Z$



## Closure algorithm

**FD Closure**: if F is a set of FDs, the **closure** $F^+$ is the set of all FDs **logically implied** by F

Armstrong's axioms are:

- **sound**: any FD generated by an axiom $\in$ $F^+$
- **complete**: can generate all $F^+$

**Attribute Closure**: If X is an attribute set, the **closure** $X^+$ is the set of all attributes B that $X\rightarrow B$



## Keys and Superkeys

**superkey**: a set of attributes that can determine all other attributes.

**key** (candidate key): a minimal superkey.

If a relation has multiple keys, we specify one to be **primary key**.



If $X^+$ = all attributes, then X is a **superkey**.

If no subset of X is a superkey, then X is also a **key**.



# Lec 10. Decomposition & Normalization I

## Decomposition

Decompose a relation into multiple relations.



|      | Lossless Join | Dependency preserving |
| ---- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| BCNF | Yes           | Not always            |
| 3NF  | Yes           | Yes                   |

## Lossless-Join Decomposition

A **natural join** is a join on the same attribute names.

A schema decomposition is **lossless-join** if $R=R'$(natural join result) for any initial instance R.

**Theorem**: Let R be a relation and F be a sets of FDs that hold over R. The decomposition of R into R1 and R2 is lossless if and only if

- $F^+$ contains either $R1 \cap R2 \rightarrow R1$ or 
- $R1 \cap R2 \rightarrow R2$

(The common attributes must contain a key for / functionally determines either R1 or R2) 

If $X\rightarrow Y$ and $X\cap Y$ is empty, the decomposition into $R-Y$ and $XY$ is lossless.



## Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

A relation R is in **BCNF** if whenever $X\rightarrow B$ is a non-trivial FD, $X$ is a superkey.

Equivalent Definition: For every attribute set $X$, the closure of it is itself or all attributes.

The only **nontrivial dependencies** are those in which a key determines some attributes.



## Normalization

Decompose into BCNF. (Keep decomposing until all relation is in BCNF).



**Dependency-preserving**: A decomposition is dependency preserving if by enforcing F1 over R1 and F2 over R2, we can enforce F over R.



# Lec 11. Decomposition & Normalization II

## Dependency-preserving decomposition

- The **Projection** of FD $F$ on attribute set $X$ is: the set of FDs in the closure $F^+$ that involve only attributes in $X$.
- The decomposition of R is **dependency-preserving** if $(F_X \cup F_Y)^+ = F^+$

## Third Normal Form (3NF)

A relation $R$ is in **3NF** if whenever $X\rightarrow A$, one of the following is true:

- $A \in X$ (i.e. trivial FD)
- $X$ is a superkey
- $A$ is part of some key in $R$

BCNF implies 3NF. (BCNF is more strict).



**Every relation** schema can be **decomposed into** a collection of **3NF relations** using only decompositions that are **lossless-join and dependency-preserving**.



## Minimal cover of FDs

A **minimal cover** for a set $F$ of FDs is $G$ such that

- every dependency in $G$ is the form $X\rightarrow A$ where A is a **single attribute**
- Closure $F^+$ = Closure $G^+$
- Deleting any dependency or attribute in $G$, $F^+ \neq G^+$

Calculate minimal cover:

- Step 1: Split the right hand side to single attributes
- Step 2: Remove redundant FDs
- Step 3: Clean up the left hand side



## Decomposition into 3NF

- Step 1: Compute a **minimal cover** $F$
- Step 2: Apply the algorithm for BCNF decomposition until all relations are in 3NF (early-stopping)
- Step 3: For each non-preserved FD $X\rightarrow A$ in $F$, add a new relation $R(X,A)$
